#### Models
#### For this data set I wanted to make sure I had a variety of different models, inorder to have the best model. I used logistic regression, Random Forest classifier, and KNeighbors. For each model I also ran the accuracy, recall, and precision score. I also ran the time for each score to provide feedback as to why the model would be the best. 
## Recommendations:
#### For future refences I would highly recomend to using the Logistic Regression model. The reasons being that it has really good accuracy scores and compaired to the other models, is efficient on time and accuracy. This model will give you the best results when predicting whether or not the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
